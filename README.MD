This is a personal project that implements TUI for global taskfile.

# The idea

The program reads `Taskfile` in `$HOME` folder and outputs list of available tasks (with their description and summary) to run. Selecting a task name calls the task with this name.


# What is ready

- [x] Reads Taskfile in current directory
- [x] TUI
